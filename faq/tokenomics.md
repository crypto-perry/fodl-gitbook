# Tokenomics

The FODL token serves as both a governance token for the fully decentralized protocol DAO, as well as a vehicle for fully decentralized revenue distribution. Token supply will never be changed, and supply distribution is as follows:\


| Ticker:                          | $FODL                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Total supply                     | 1,000,000,000            |

> :exclamation:  Starting August 2022 Fodl position rewards were paused so the APR is 0. See DAO vote [here](https://snapshot.org/#/fodl-dao.eth/proposal/0x74c90282443385935c8527cfd47b65e93d0a7466b1913eec8abed6285717994e)!
