# DAO

As the FODL supply becomes more and more distributed amongst the community to the users of the platform and liquidity providers, weâ€™re looking toward a DAO community with full control over the platform, and access to 100% of protocol revenue via xFODL, FODL-ETH and FODL-USDC LPs (Sushi).&#x20;

Over time, the team behind Fodl plans to further decentralize the platform, along with its development, upkeep, and running of stop loss/take profit and liquidation bots. Using the 10% of FODL supply allocated for development grants, and combined with the DAO, the project will seek to fund a community of developers and strategists around the platform, to completely decentralize the project.&#x20;

The DAO's primary function is the distribution of revenue and fine tuning the projects parameters including fee amounts, rewards schedules for staking and liquidity mining. \
