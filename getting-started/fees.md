# Fees

Fodl fees are designed to be simple to understand, transparently calculated on-chain, and low.

### Reward Token Fees

* Fodl takes 10% of governance token rewards from the underlying position.&#x20;
  * Ie. when a user opens a folded position on Compound, they will receive a certain APR in $COMP.&#x20;
* The Fodl protocol will take 10% of those $COMP tokens as the margin funding rate.&#x20;

### Profit Share Fees

* Fodl takes 2.5% profit share of appreciating long or short positions.&#x20;
* 2.5% is only applied to profit, not principle.
  * I.e. if the position does not close in profit, Fodl does not take any % of the position.&#x20;

### Purpose of fees

* Reward token fees provide a leverage trading experience with fully decentralized liquidity, where usersâ€™ positions pay their own funding rates.&#x20;
* Profit share fees enable low platform fees which do not dig into the principle of users who do not profit.&#x20;
  * Unlike fees for opening and closing positions on other platforms, which dig into principle, Fodl shares 2.5% of profitable position gains while unprofitable users to go untaxed.
  * The goal is to provide a low risk, forgiving fee structure where the protocol only takes fees from profits derived from using the protocol.&#x20;

### How are Fodl fees used?

* 10% of gov tokens earned are used to purchase FODL from liquidity providers in FODL-ETH LP
* 2.5% of profits from long / short positions also are used to purchase FODL from FODL-ETH LP
* Platform fees are 100% driven to long term supporters of the platform--those who hold their FODL token rewards. \
