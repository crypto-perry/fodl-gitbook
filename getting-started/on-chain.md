# On-chain

One of the goals of FODL is to align the platform with the ethos of DeFi - a fully decentralized platform, revenue distribution model, and user experience.&#x20;

Current iterations of (decentralized) leverage trading platforms do not operate fully on-chain; trading fees are calculated off-chain and are opaque. With Fodl, everything is calculated and executed on-chain, all positions and calculations are handled on-chain using live market data.&#x20;

Users do not send their funds to a centralized pool or protocol. Users maintain the keys to their positions, and have the option to enable stop loss and take profit bots only to unwrap their positions. All revenue from the protocol is utilized to buyback the protocolâ€™s token from decentralized liquidity pools, meaning no revenue will ever be sent to a team wallet or central party.&#x20;
