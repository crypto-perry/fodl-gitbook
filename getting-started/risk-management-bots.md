# Bots

One of the primary benefits of Fodl are its smart contract bots. Three primary bots provide unique value for traders:

### Liquidation Bots

* Prevents your position from being liquidated when its health falls to maximum (your position is closed instead of liquidated).&#x20;
* Liquidation bots cover all positions open on the Fodl platform.&#x20;

### Stop Loss Bots

* Sets a lower-bound price / value at which your position should be closed (mitigating losses at a threshold).
* Users can configure custom stop loss price points.

### Take Profit Bots

* Sets an upper-bound price / value at which your position should be closed (booking profits at a threshold).&#x20;
* Users can configure custom take profit price points.

These bots offer traders reliable functionality to set “limits orders” for their leveraged trades.&#x20;

Please note that bots are not currently active in a beta version of FODL finance.

Bots will become active in a final release.

Please use extra caution when using FODL beta.

While Fodl bots have proven reliable and fast, due to the nature of Ethereum relying on miners and network performance to execute transactions, no transaction can be 100% guaranteed to execute (even if using Fodl bots).&#x20;
