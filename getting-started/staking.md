# Staking

Staking for Fodl is available only for FODL-ETH liquidity providers. Once a provider has added liquidity to FODL-ETH, they will be able to stake their LP tokens for additional FODL rewards. This is in addition to all Fodl protocol fee revenue being distributed via buyback of FODL tokens from the FODL-ETH LP.&#x20;

This means liquidity providers receive revenue from 3 sources:

* Standard liquidity provider fees from trading activity of FODL-ETH
* Receive all Fodl protocol revenue via FODL buyback from FODL-ETH LP
* FODL-ETH LP token stakers receive additional token rewards&#x20;
