# What is FODL?

## Welcome to FODL

The FODL platform combines several money "legos" of the DeFi ecosystem - flash loans and collateral lending platforms, combined with proprietary position protection bots and cross-asset price indexing - to build a **fully decentralized leverage trading platform**.

FODL enables traders to utilize leverage for their trades without paying a funding rate. This leverage is derived from existing DeFi building blocks, **Compound and Aave**. In essence, traditional DeFi borrow/lend platforms are turned into money markets providing users with leverage by margining your assets to yourself. Our motto is: Be your own funding rate!

Additionally, FODL follows a decentralized ethos of **transparency, low fees, user autonomy and distributed revenue distribution**. All positions and calculations are handled **on-chain** using live market data, users maintain the keys to their positions and do not send funds to a central pool, or protocol, and FODL fee revenue is distributed entirely to FODL LPs via buybacks - essentially decentralizing all protocol revenue. Not your keys, not your coins.

## Why we built FODL

We built FODL to meet the need for highly liquid, low-cost, and fully on-chain leverage. Rather than reinventing a centralized exchange, we looked for how we could utilize existing DeFi building blocks to accomplish our goals ‚Äì further bolstering existing platforms with new use cases. Collateralized lending platforms in combination with flash loans turned out to be a great method of using highly liquid markets to achieve decentralized leverage.
