# What is FODL?

## Mission

FODL's mission is to revitalize the DeFi space by bringing classically complex financial instruments to the masses. FODL's approach to derivatives allows users to self-custody their funds while being exposed to on-chain leverage features, enabling true self-stewardship of trades.

## Welcome to FODL

The FODL platform combines several money "legos" of the DeFi ecosystem - flash loans (Aave), lending platforms (Aave, Compound), decentralised automated market makers (Uniswap, QuickSwap, PancakeSwap), combined with proprietary position protection bots - to build a **fully decentralized leverage trading platform**.

FODL enables traders to optimise their earning potential by using leverage for their trades while paying a minimal funding rate derived from the supply and borrow interest rates of assets on a DeFi lending market.

Additionally, FODL follows a decentralized ethos of **transparency, low fees, user autonomy and distributed revenue distribution**. All positions and calculations are handled **on-chain** using live market data, users own their positions via an NFT linked to a per-position smart wallet and do not send funds to a central pool, or protocol. FODL fee revenue is entirely controlled by the DAO - essentially decentralizing all protocol revenue.

### üë®‚Äçüåæ Yield Farmers // üìà Traders

Yield Farmers and Traders are able to open same-asset or no-price-risk positions on FODL, gaining leveraged exposure to their preferred asset while earning yield. For example, a yield farmer may open a position supplying USDC and borrowing USDT in an attempt to arbitrage between the supply interest on USDC and the borrow interest on USDT. Usually such strategies are meant to "farm" governance rewards such as AAVE or COMP. The only risk involved in such a strategy is the systemic risk of depeg of USDC or USDT which can be regarded as relatively low.

### ü§ñ FODL Bots

The proprietary FODL smart contract bots are used to protect leveraged positions on the FODL platform against liquidation. Users can set a threshold of position health at which they wish their position to be automatically closed. This allows for passive trading while avoiding the high liquidation incentive that would otherwise be paid to Aave or Compound in case of a margin call.

### üèõÔ∏è DAO members

Through the FODL governance token, holders can participate in FODL DAO, determining the trajectory of the protocol and how the revenue from protocol fees should be used.

## Why we built FODL

We built FODL to meet the need for highly liquid, low-cost, and fully on-chain leverage. Rather than reinventing a centralized exchange, we looked for how we could utilize existing DeFi building blocks to accomplish our goals ‚Äì further bolstering existing platforms with new use cases. DeFi lending platforms in combination with flash loans turned out to be a great method of using highly liquid markets to achieve decentralized leverage.

## On-Chain

One of the goals of FODL is to align the platform with the ethos of DeFi - a fully decentralized platform relying on composability of other DeFi products to offer a more streamlined user experience.

Current iterations of (decentralized) leverage trading platforms do not operate fully on-chain; trading fees are calculated off-chain and are opaque. With FODL, everything is calculated and executed on-chain, all positions and calculations are handled on-chain using live market data.&#x20;

Users do not send their funds to a centralized pool or protocol as each position is an isolated smart wallet. This allows for integrating stop loss and take profit bots with a user-configurable incentives system.
