{% hint style="warning" %}
The higher your leverage, the more profitable your position will be if you are right. However, the higher your leverage the higher your starting health limit (you'll start closer to possible liquidation), so the less room you have for the market to move opposite your bet before your position is closed. Selecting lower leverage is safer!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

4\. Input the amount of assets you want to supply, and click 'Enter Position'
