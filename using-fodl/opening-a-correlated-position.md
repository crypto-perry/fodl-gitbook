# Opening correlated positions

Correlated positions can be defined as Fodls where the supply and borrow asset prices are generally correlated or exactly the same. These positions are focused on maximizing governance token farming, while reducing risk.

## Opening a correlated position on Fodl

1. Select assets that are perfectly correlated for both the Supply and Borrow side (e.g. USDC & USDC)

OR&#x20;

Select assets that are generally correlated for the Supply and Borrow side (e.g. ETH & WBTC)\

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be careful to watch your generally correlated positions! Assets that are generally correlated do from time to time decouple and can end up being an unintended long or short!
{% endhint %}

3\. Select your desired leverage. You can use the slider or the buttons

## Examples

Example in action: Supply 500,000 USDC to borrow DAI @ 2.5x Leverage&#x20;

* Your net starting position would be:&#x20;
  * Supply: 1,250,000 USDC
  * Borrow: 750,000 DAI ($750,000)
  * Health: 75%

Example in action: Close position

* Sell 750,000 USDC for 750,000 DAI
* Repay 750,000 DAI
* User has profited on governance reward tokens with 10% share of 2x profits via 2x leverage
