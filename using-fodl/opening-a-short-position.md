# Opening short positions

Short positions are defined as Fodls where the supplied asset is a stablecoin and the borrowed asset is a non-stablecoin. The positions are for users who are bearish on market conditions and seek to profit from price depreciation of assets against fiat stablecoins.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The higher your leverage the more profitable your position will be if you are right. However, the higher your leverage the higher your starting health limit (closer to liquidation/close out position), so the less room you have for the market to move opposite your bet before your position is closed. Selecting lower leverage is safer!

4\. Input the amount of assets you want to supply, and click 'Enter Position'&#x20;
